Systems programming toolchain: Assembly, Linker and Emulator
This project embodies a CPU emulator designed for a specific RISC architecture alongside its corresponding toolchain, which includes an assembly component and a linker. Implemented in C++, it simulates the entire process of parsing input code, exporting symbols, managing memory, and handling registers. Additionally, it facilitates the linking of object files and their conversion into executable ones.
